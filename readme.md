This is just a small little password manager I made over 24hrs to add to my portfolio, it uses Fernet to encrypt the passwords based on the key you make, and also uses a master password to ensure files cant be found on dekstop and used without confirming it is the right user.

The password manager is just a fleshed out - gui made manager based of a tutorial made by Neural Nine see below:
